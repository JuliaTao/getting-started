# Instructions:

#Step 1. Get on IBM Data Science Experience (DSX).
##Create an account.

1.  Go to [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/)

2.  Click the signup button on the top right

3. If you have a Bluemix account you can click continue with Bluemix credentials, otherwise click create your Bluemix account and enter your email. 

4. You should get an email from "ibmacct" with your IBMid Confirmation code

8. It will take a minute to create your account. When ready, click on Get Started.

 > You are now in the Data Science Experience landing page. Your environment is automatically set up with one Apache Spark instance and 5 GB of object storage. From here you can explore any of the tutorials, videos, sample notebooks, totorials or articles in the community.

#Step 2. Create a project 

1. Click on the left hand side "hamburger" icon and then click on My Projects to see a list of your projects. You should only see a default project.

2. Click on the create project icon on the top right of the project list. 

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/images/create-new-project.png"/>

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "Word2Vec for Text Data". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a defualt name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.

 > You are now in your new project where you can create notebooks and data assets as well as add collaborators.

#Step 3. Get the data into DSX 

1. Download (without uncompressing) some tweets from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/82rrk8di2nouf0x/AAAIMc6J9rWpu08UBLhLbHXEa?dl=0) to your lap top. The `tweets.gz` file contains a 10% sample (using Twitter decahose API) of a 15 minute batch of the public tweets from December 23rd. The size of this compressed file is 116MB (compression ratio is about 10 to 1).

2. Go to your recently created project on DSX and click on the add data assets + icon

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/images/add-data-asset.png"/>

3. Click on the Add file and select the tweets.gz file from your lap top and click on open

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/images/add-file.png"/>

4. Wait until the file is loaded

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/images/data-loading.png"/>

5. Once the file is loaded, click on Apply to add this file to your project.

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/images/apply-add-file.png"/>
 
  > You should see your tweets under the data assets list of your project. Your tweets are now loaded in your object storage in the container associated to your project. If your project name is "Word2Vec for Text Data", the default container name is Word2VecforTextData (unless you change to a different name on Step 2, part 3).

#Step 4. Get the notebook, open it and follow the instructions inside the notebook

1. Go back to your project and click on the create new notebook icon

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/images/proj-with-tweets.png"/>
 
2. Click on From URL (3rd tab), choose a name for your notebook (ex: "Spark-based ML to capture word meaning"), copy and paste this url **https://github.com/IBMDataScience/word2vec/blob/master/Spark-based%20machine%20learning%20for%20word%20meanings.ipynb** into the Notebook URL rectangle and finally click on Create Notebook.
